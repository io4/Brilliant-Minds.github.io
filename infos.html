      <h4>Goals</h4>
      I wish to make it the goal of all of BMN to be the greatest at what we do. My goal is to have <b>at least</b> two BMN member-made saves on the first page at the same time, and that whenever someone searches the words Ship, Sea, Weapon or Bomb, they see BMN member-made saves <b>first</b>.

      <hr>

      <h4>Rules and Trials</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>No trolling of any kind</li>
        <li>No spamming</li>
        <li>No abusing of group manager privilegues</li>
        <li>No inappropiate/hateful/racist posts</li>
        <li>Don't get you TPT account banned without an adequate reason</li>
        <li>Don't lie about anything serious or to a Commanding Officer</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Probation Punishments</h5>
      <p>
        For anything excessively profane, if you got banned for it in TPT, you <b>will</b> be demoted and placed on level 3 probation for 4 weeks, then you will be moved to level 1 probation.<br>
        <b>If you get 5 punishments like this, you will be banned from the group.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        For any other few-days ban, the Fleet Admiral will ask you for the reason and then ask jacob1 about it. If the reasons don't match, you will be demoted once.<br>
        For any unnescessary ban, a trial and a hearing will be convened. This will determine what punishment is given, if any.
      </p>

      <h5>Probation Levels</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Level 1: Light restrictions from group activities, it will <b>not</b> affect your promotion. May go on your record and lasts for one week.</li>
        <li>Level 2: Medium restrictions from group activities. <b>May</b> affect your promotion during the next Inactive Movement Cycle, and this may go on your record.<br>
        If you receive this and then receive a level 3 probation, you will be <b>discharged</b>. Lasts for 3 weeks.</li>
        <li>Level 3: Whatever you did to deserve this, it was bad. Heavy restrictions from group activities, no promotion in the next two IMCs, and if you get another level 2 or higher probation, you will be <b>discharged</b>.<br>
        Also, any Admirals Counsel members who are a group manager and get this probation will be changed down to a Member for 2 months. Will go on you record. Lasts for 3 months.</li>
        <li>Level 4 (<i>waiting list</i>): This essentially means that we are deciding who you are being replaced with. Goodbye.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Trials</h5>
      For any severe (or at least partially) offense made by an Admiral, a trial will be convened. There shall be a prosecutor, defense attourney, jury of peers (people of the same counsel), testimonials and a judge (the current Fleet Admiral). All people participating in this trial will have their ranks suspended for reasons against biased judgement, except the judge.<br>
      Any actual offense made by an Admiral is more serious than that of any other member, obviously. But if an Admiral is being prosecuted, <b>no one below the AC sit-in Commander may post to the thread.</b> Breaking this rule is punishable by <b>discharge.</b>

      Records are just posts that pertain to a certain person's actions and description. Once you do something worth mentioning, you will get a record. Plus, they are for showing off awards and achievements.<br>
      With the introduction of the website, the records are now placed <a href="members.html">here</a>.

      <h4>Admirals Counsel</h4>
      The Admirals Counsel is comprised of the Admiral positions. The AC is where all rule creations, changes and fixes will be made, as well as promotions, demotions and member removals (discharges).<br>
      <ul>
        <li>For a member to be removed, three out of the five top Admirals have to vote yes.</li>
        <li>For a demotion, any four Admirals must vote for yes, unless vetoed by an Admiral or the current Fleet Admiral.</li>
        <li>Promotions need four Admirals to vote for yes, of course the new rank must be open and not taken yet.</li>
        <li>A non-Admiral requires six Admirals to vote yes so he/she can join the AC.</li>
        <li>For a rule creation or change, more than half of the Admirals need to vote yes. For a rule fix, it only needs three unless vetoed by the top five Admirals.</li>
      </ul>
      Any thread that is tagged with "(AC)" means that it is an Admirals Counsel discussion only. You may watch it, but only Captains and Commander AC sit-ins max post there.<br>
      There may be a few exceptions where we allow Captains, Commanders and maybe even Lieutenant Commanders into the AC.

      <hr>

      <h4>Rates and Ranks of BMN</h4>
      <h5>Officer Ranks</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="label badge-warning">Fleet Admiral</span> Highest power of BMN. Head of the Admirals Counsel. There is only one of these at a time.</li>
        <li><span class="label badge-warning">Admiral</span> Second highest power. High leadership position in the AC. There are only two of these, and they can veto any decision made by the Fleet Admiral.</li>

      <h4>Advertisement</h4>
      If you wish to advertise this group, make sure you are smart about it. If you made a thread and you wish to advertise BMN inside it, go ahead. I'm just warning you though, it almost always kills the topic.<br>
      You may message people over the PM system, but please make sure you let them know that your message isn't spam, just an invite. <b>Do not</b> get into fights with people about this. If they say no, you say okay and move on.<br>
      Even of they give you a highly invalid reason, do not fight with them over it. They are entitled to their own opinions.<br>
      Happy advertising.

      <hr>

      <h4>Inactive Movement Cycle (IMC/IRC)</h4>
      Around every month there will be an event called the Inactive Movement Cycle. I will be moving around people who are inactive frequently and promoting very frequent, deserving users.<br>
      <b>Note:</b> If you go on vavation and you have no idea if an IMC is coming soon, tell me about it and tell me when you get back. If you warn me in advance, you will be safe from the movement.

      <hr>

      <h4>Group Project Method</h4>
      Projects will be the collaborative efforts of the group to make great additions to the Powder Toy realm.<br>
      <h5>How to do a project</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Upload the initial save</li>
        <li>The next person to work on it does so and uploads it</li>
        <li>Cycle continues</li>
        <li>The project gets finished</li>
        <li>It gets uploaded under the <b>initial</b> creators account. Credit is given to <b>all</b> helpers. Include <b>all</b> ranks.</li>
      </ul>
      The initial creator has full direction, unless overridden by the AC.
