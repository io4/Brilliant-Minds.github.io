<h4 id="goals">Goals</h4>
I wish to make it the goal of all of BMN to be the greatest at what we do. My goal is to have <b>at least</b> five BMN member-made saves on the first page at the same time, and that whenever someone searches the words Ship, Weapon or Bomb, they see BMN member-made saves <b>first</b>.

<h4 id="savelogo">BMN Save Logo</h4>
This is the logo for BMN. It would benefit us a <b>lot</b> if you could put one of these logos into your saves.<br>

<h4 id="advertisement">Advertisement</h4>
<p>If you wish to advertise this group, make sure you are smart about it. If you made a thread and you wish to advertise BMN inside it, go ahead. I'm just warning you though, it almost always kills the topic.<br />
  You may message people over the PM system, but please make sure you let them know that your message isn't spam, just an invite. <b>Do not</b> get into fights with people about this. If they say no, you say okay and move on.<br />
  Even if they give you a highly invalid reason, do not fight with them over it. They are entitled to their own opinions.<br />
  Happy advertising.
