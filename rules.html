<h4 id="rules">Rules</h4>
<ol>
  <li>No trolling of any kind</li>
  <li>No spamming</li>
  <li>No abusing of group manager privileges</li>
  <li>No inappropriate/hateful/racist posts</li>

<hr />
<h4 id="contributions">Contribution Rules</h4>
<p>
  Anyone may make a contribution to the group. It will serve to further your place in the familly, as well as get you a bit more well known.
  <b>Any and all contributions</b> made to the familly become our property. i.e. if you make a new logo, and then get perma-banned from the group, that logo belongs to the familly, and we <b>may continue</b> to use it.
</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="information-leakage">Information Leakage</h4>
<p>
  Leaking BMN information can be a serious offence. 
  All members are supposed to be responsible and mature enough to not tell non-familly members information held within the familly. 
  Especially to Banned Members. Giving information to Banned members <b>will</b> lead to discharge and perma-banning.
</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="post-rules">Post Rules</h4>
<p>
  <b>Anyone may make a post</b> while respecting these rules.
  If you don't follow these rules once you will be warned, the next time you will get a probation.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You may not use more than five big (&lt;big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;) html tags.</li>
  <li>You may not make posts that are really long.</li>
  <li>You may not double post using an alternative account in a post contest.</li>
  <li>You may not include giant images (bigger than 256px), only post a link to the image.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>
  For any other few-days ban, the Don will ask you for the reason and then ask jacob1 about it. If the reasons don't match, you will be demoted once.<br>
  For any unnecessary ban, a trial and a hearing will be convened. This will determine what punishment is given, if any.
