      <h4 id="preofficers">Preofficer Ranks</h4>
      <ul>
        <li id="rank-officer-candidate"><span class="label label-success">Officer Candidate</span> Essentially the waiting list to replace Officers which are being removed.</li>
        <li id="rank-seaman"><span class="label label-default">Seaman</span> One below Officer Candidate. They begin training for Officer ranks here. This rank was renamed from "Upper Recruit"</li>
        <li id="rank-seaman-apprentice"><span class="label label-default">Seaman Apprentice</span> Everyone starts here. As long as you post 5 times, you will be promoted. If you don't get promoted from here within a week, you will be removed. This rank was renamed from "Lower Recruit"</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="special">Special Ranks</h4>
      <ul>
        <li id="rank-chief-warrant"><span class="label label-primary">Chief Warrant</span> This is a neutral rank. People who are in these spots used to hold officer positions, but then realized they couldn't be as active anymore. So instead of getting a demotion, they get transferred over to their corresponding Warrant Officer rank</li>
        <li id="rank-probationary"><span class="label label-danger">Probationary</span> Lower than Seaman Apprentice. If a Probationary does ANYTHING 'bad', they will be kicked and perma-banned from BMN.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr>

      <h4 id="admirals-counsel">Admirals Counsel</h4>
      The Admirals Counsel is comprised of the Admiral positions. The AC is where all rule creations, changes and fixes will be made, as well as promotions, demotions and member removals (discharges).<br>
      <ul>
        <li>For a member to be removed, three out of the five top Admirals have to vote yes.</li>
        <li>For a demotion, any four Admirals must vote for yes, unless vetoed by an Admiral or the current Fleet Admiral.</li>
        <li>Promotions need four Admirals to vote for yes, of course the new rank must be open and not taken yet.</li>
        <li>A non-Admiral requires six Admirals to vote yes so he/she can join the AC.</li>
        <li>For a rule creation or change, more than half of the Admirals need to vote yes. For a rule fix, it only needs three unless vetoed by the top five Admirals.</li>
      </ul>

      Any thread that is tagged with "(AC)" means that it is an Admirals Counsel discussion only. You may watch it, but only Captains and Commander AC sit-ins may post there.<br>
      There may be a few exceptions where we allow Captains, Commanders and maybe even Lieutenant Commanders into the AC.

      <h4 id="imc">Inactive Movement Cycle (IMC/IRC)</h4>
      Around every month there will be an event called the Inactive Movement Cycle. I will be moving around people who are inactive frequently and promoting very frequent, deserving users.<br>
      <b>Note:</b> If you go on vacation and you have no idea if an IMC is coming soon, tell me about it and tell me when you get back. If you warn me in advance, you will be safe from the movement.
